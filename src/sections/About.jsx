          My name is Thanh Dat, I'm a web developer and designer and a
          third-year student at FPT University (as of this project). I have a
          passion for creating beautiful and functional websites, with a strong
          background in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, and .NET. I am
          always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow
          as a developer and designer.
